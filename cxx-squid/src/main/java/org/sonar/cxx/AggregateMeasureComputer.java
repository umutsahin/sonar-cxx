/**
 * SonarQube supports hierarchical multi-module projects. It is not enough to calculate a metric M for the file and/or
 * for the corresponding module. The same metric has to be calculated/propagated/aggregated for all parent modules and
 * the root project.
 *
 * This {@link MeasureComputer} is executed on Compute Engine (server-side). For each metric M in the given set of
 * metrics the sum on the hierarchy level L is calculated. The sum is persisted as aggregated metric M on the level
 * (L-1).
 *
 * Some CXX sensors (see CxxReportSensor) can create issues on the whole module. Such sensors have to aggregate the
 * corresponding module Metric by themselves. {@link AggregateMeasureComputer} doesn't recalculate already aggregated
 * metrics.
